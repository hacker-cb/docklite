# DockLite Development Phases

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- **Multi-tenancy architecture** - user isolation with system_user mapping
- **Projects CRUD API** with ownership and slug-based paths
- **14 docker-compose presets** (web servers, databases, CMS, monitoring)
- **JWT authentication** with role-based access control
- **User Management** - CRUD, password management, admin controls
- **SSH deployment** - per-user isolation via system users
- **Vue.js 3 + PrimeVue UI** with modern component architecture
- **Clean architecture** - Services, Models, Validators, Utils, Constants
- Initial test coverage

### ✅ Phase 2: Container Management
- **Docker service** for docker-compose orchestration via SSH
- **Container lifecycle API** - start, stop, restart, status
- **Real-time status** from Docker API
- **UI controls** for container management with ownership checks
- **Deployment info** endpoint with instructions

### ✅ Phase 3: Production Ready
- **Comprehensive testing** - 157 backend tests, 120+ frontend tests
- **Test coverage** - ~95% overall coverage
- **Validators** - compose validation, domain validation
- **Error handling** - custom exceptions, proper error messages
- **API documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Production architecture** - ready for deployment
