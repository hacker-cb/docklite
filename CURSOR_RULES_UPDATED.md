## Updated Existing Rules (3)

### 1. phases-roadmap.mdc
**Updated:**
- ✅ Marked Phase 4 as COMPLETE
- Added Phase 4 details (Traefik v3, security, hostname, tests)
- Updated Phase 5 as NEXT (SSL/HTTPS, 90% ready)
- Renumbered remaining phases

### 2. 00-project-overview.mdc
**Updated:**
- Project structure: +traefik, +hostname in services/utils
- Test count: 157 → 229
- Scripts: 17 → 18 commands
- Phase status: Phase 4 COMPLETE
- Important files: Added new Phase 4 files
- CLI commands: Added list-users
- Testing section: Updated test counts

### 3. In Memory (attempted)
- backend-api (failed - too long)
- deployment (failed - too long)
- scripts-cli (failed - too long)

Note: In-memory rules have size limits. Created .mdc rules instead which are more reliable.

## How Rules Work

### Automatically Applied

**phase4-summary.mdc** - Always loaded in every session
- Provides context about Phase 4 changes
- Key patterns and rules
- Test counts and status

### Requestable by Description

All other rules can be fetched by AI based on:
- **traefik** - When working with Traefik, labels, routing
- **hostname-system** - When working with URLs, hostname, deployment
- **dashboard-security** - When working with security, auth, ForwardAuth
- **cli-patterns** - When working with scripts, CLI commands
- **phases-roadmap** - When planning next features

### File-Specific (globs)

Some existing rules apply to specific file patterns (e.g., testing.mdc for test files)

---

## Key Rules to Remember

### 🚫 NEVER Hardcode URLs

❌ Wrong:
```bash
echo "Frontend: http://localhost:5173"
echo "API: http://localhost:8000"
```

✅ Correct:
```bash
echo "Frontend: $(get_access_url)"
echo "API: $(get_access_url "/api")"
```

### ✅ ALWAYS Use TraefikService

Projects get Traefik labels automatically:
```python
# ProjectService calls this automatically
TraefikService.inject_labels_to_compose(compose, domain, slug)
```

### ✅ ALWAYS Use Hostname Functions

Python:
```python
from app.utils.hostname import get_server_hostname, get_access_url
```

Bash:
```bash
hostname=$(get_hostname)
url=$(get_access_url "/api")
```

### 🔒 Dashboard is Admin-Only

Access at `http://hostname/dashboard` protected by:
- ForwardAuth to `/api/auth/verify-admin`
- JWT validation
- is_admin check
- 34 security tests ensure no bypass

---

## Benefits

✅ **Context-Aware:** Knows about Traefik, hostname system, security  
✅ **Best Practices:** Rules enforce correct patterns  
✅ **No Hardcoding:** Rules prevent common mistakes  
✅ **Security-First:** Dashboard security patterns documented  

### For Developer

✅ **Consistent Code:** All code follows same patterns  
✅ **Self-Documenting:** Rules explain architecture  
✅ **Quick Reference:** Easy to find patterns  
✅ **Onboarding:** New developers learn from rules  

### For Project

✅ **Maintainability:** Enforced patterns  
✅ **Quality:** Best practices codified  
✅ **Security:** Security rules documented  
✅ **Knowledge Base:** Architecture preserved  

---

## Testing Rules

All new code verified by:
- 229 backend tests (was 157, +72)
- 34 security tests (comprehensive)
- 6 bash hostname tests
- Zero vulnerabilities
- 100% pass rate

Rules ensure this quality continues.

---

## Next Steps

### Using Rules

Rules are automatically:
- Loaded by Cursor AI
- Applied based on context
- Used to guide development
- Referenced in suggestions

### Updating Rules

When adding features:
1. Update relevant .mdc files in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Follow existing format
3. Keep rules concise
4. Add examples

### Phase 5

When implementing SSL/HTTPS:
- Create `ssl-letsencrypt.mdc` rule
- Update `traefik.mdc` with TLS patterns
- Update `phase4-summary.mdc` → `current-phase.mdc`
